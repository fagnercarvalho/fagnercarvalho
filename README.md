### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fagner and I have more 14+ years of experience in Tech, having worked in companies of all sizes in different technologies (Go, C#, JavaScript, Java).

Most important projects I worked in the past:
- A payment gateway responsible for over 25 million dollars in transactions for customers in the US.
- A waste management application used by 100+ clients and multiple truck drivers each.
- A hotel reservation site used for more than 120+ events a year in the US for the health industry.
- An internship site used by more than 30000 grad and post grad students in one of the best universities in Latin America.
- Actively contributed in open source projects such as .NET Core, Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core.

My current focus is fintech and observability in a Fintech in Canada but before I worked with:
- The 2nd biggest Credit Union in Brazil (Sicredi) with Java where I was responsible for maintaining their internal systems.
- The 5th biggest Life Insurance company in Brazil (Seguros Unimed) with C# where I was responsible for maintaining logic to calculate premiums and create policy and also automate processes to improve Developer Experience
- The biggest banks in Brazil in the Investment Funds Market (ANBIMA) with C# where I was responsible by a middleware that integrated two big Investment Funds systems
- A MDM (Mobile Device Management) company with C# where I was responsible for developing their new MDM solution from scratch
- The biggest Waste Management players in the US (Waste Managemt, Waste Connections, GFL Environmental and a lot of other smaller players) with a Waste Management Software company (AMCS Group) where I worked with C# and Go and I was responsible for a payment middleware for 2 Payment Gateways that transacted millions of dollars and also for creating the flow for a automated kiosk for a MRF (Material Recovery Facility) that replaced a manual operator that would input data into a system every time a truck was getting in or out of the facility bringing or taking raw material from it.

### My IoT setup

I have a IoT setup at home that runs:
- Home Assistant to agreggate Zigbee and MQTT sensor states
- Grafana to create custom dashboards for all sensors and alerts to detect if something is wrong in any of the sensors
- OTel Collector to flow metrics from Home Assistant to Grafana
- RTL-433 to capture Radio signals from sensors and flow to MQTT

For more details on this setup please check the following repositories:

- https://github.com/fagnercarvalho/docker-rtl-433-mqtt
- https://github.com/fagnercarvalho/dnsmasq-nginx
- Home Assistant + Mosquitto as the MQTT broker (private repository)

Also, feel free to look at my public repositories, although I do the vast majority of my work with proprietary code I do some experiments/cool (?) stuff in public too. ðŸ™‚
