### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fagner and I have more than 10 years of experience in Tech, working in companies of all sizes in different technologies (Java, C#, JavaScript, Go).

My current focus is Fintech, Observability and IOT in a Fintech in Canada but before I worked with:
- The 2nd biggest Credit Union in Brazil (Sicredi) with Java where I was responsible for maintaining their internal systems.
- The 5th biggest Life Insurance company in Brazil (Seguros Unimed) with C# where I was responsible for maintaining logic to calculate premiums and create policy and also automate processes to improve Developer Experience
- The biggest banks in Brazil in the Investment Funds Market (ANBIMA) with C# where I was responsible by a middleware that integrated two big Investment Funds systems
- A MDM (Mobile Device Management) company with C# where I was responsible for developing their new MDM solution from scratch
- The biggest Waste Management players in the US (Waste Managemt, Waste Connections, GFL Environmental and a lot of other smaller players) with a Waste Management Software company (AMCS Group) where I worked with C# and Go and I was responsible for a payment middleware for 2 Payment Gateways that transacted millions of dollars and also for creating the flow for a automated kiosk for a MRF (Material Recovery Facility) that replaced a manual operator that would input data into a system every time a truck was getting in or out of the facility bringing or taking raw material from it.

### My IOT setup

I have a IOT setup at home that runs:
- Home Assistant to agreggate Zigbee and MQTT sensor states
- Grafana to create custom dashboards for all sensors and alerts to detect if something is wrong in any of the sensors
- OTEL Collector to flow metrics from Home Assistant to Grafana
- RTL-433 to capture Radio signals from sensors and flow to MQTT

For more details on this setup please check the following repositories:

Also, feel free to look at my public repositories, although I do the vast majority of my work with proprietary code I do some experiments/cool (?) stuff in public too. ðŸ™‚
